Inspired by a combination of the original [ezarr](https://github.com/Luctia/ezarr), martinbjeldbak's [self-hosted](https://github.com/martinbjeldbak/self-hosted), and trinib's [AdGuard-WireGuard-Unbound-DNScrypt](https://github.com/trinib/AdGuard-WireGuard-Unbound-DNScrypt) projects, this is intended to unify the three methodologies into one server. Using Docker to deploy a secure hosting environment with a well-managed media server. 

Hopefully this will eventually look something like this:
